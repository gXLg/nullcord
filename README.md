# nullcord
Lightweight custom discord bot library developed by `/dev/null`.

This lib is for private use, using in production is not recommended.

Plans are to make the lib production ready with v3.0

Right now have got some untested things, which will probably change:
* Sharding
* Endpoints objects for easier and more intuitive use
* Constants

Have to implement:
* Error codes detection
* Voice UwU
* Even smarter shard distribution

FYI: Even it being not production ready, the lib is stable and is working perfectly,
so if you really want to - you can use the lib and your bot will not break :)

# Installation

```
npm install nullcord
```

# Documentation
Oh hell nah :skull: . The structure is being changed very actively at the moment,
so writing docs at this early stage just makes no sense. As already mentioned above,
production ready lib is planned for v3.0, that's when I will implement
all the needed stuff and will write the docs. Although this lib is not for production use,
it is built quite intuitive so far, so if you want to use the lib,
go ahead - look into the code and write your bot.
