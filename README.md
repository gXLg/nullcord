# For Fun
Some interesting facts all around nullcord:
* The name should always be written in lowercase
* The name obviously comes from my nickname `/dev/null` and `discord`
* This lib was completely developed on my phone
("mobile developer" just got a new meaning, huh?)
* The internet at my house was/is so bad, that it created a perfect
environment for debugging connectivity related issues
* I developed this while listening to breakcore and drinking
69 liters of coffee a night (I am broke and have an addiction now, please help)
* This library got 2 of my testing bots banned, but it's safe
to use now, I swear!
* If there would have been an award for the worst structured documentation
of rate limits, discord would surely receive it. I am so happy, I am through
with this, it was a nightmare!
* The logo has been made in Paint in under 5 minutes :D
